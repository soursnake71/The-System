# Omega plugins

The Omega System's instruments and effects as separate VST3 plugins (AU too on Mac), for any desktop DAW.
The sound engines are line-for-line C++ ports of the web app's own code (`index.html`); `tools/compare.mjs` runs the
app's code in Node and the C++ in `tools/dsp_test.cpp` on the same signal, and their levels match.

| Plugin | Type |
|---|---|
| Omega Prophet-5 | instrument |
| Omega Vox (Prophet-5 + vocoder + talking machine) | instrument |
| Omega Speech (talking machine) | instrument |
| Omega Vocoder 350 | effect (MIDI or sidechain carrier) |
| Omega Lexicon 224, PrimeTime, Effectron, DP4, Microverb, ADA Flanger, 1176, Phil Collins Sim, H910, MXR 113 | effects |
| Omega Bus Compressor, Resonance Tamer, Gate Stepper | effects |

Download: the `vst3-latest` release has a zip for Windows, Mac and Linux, built by `.github/workflows/vst3.yml`.

Build yourself: `cmake -S plugins -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build --config Release`.
Parameter tables come from the app: `node plugins/tools/gen.mjs` regenerates `gen/tables.inc`.
