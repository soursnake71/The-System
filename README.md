# Pocket Rack

A small phone DAW: 16-pad drum rack with MPC-style real-time recording, sample chopping, synth tracks with an in-key grid, warped audio tracks from a USB-C interface, scenes and song mode, MIDI clock sync with an MPC, automation, effects (EQ, filter, compressor, saturator, redux, chorus, auto pan, sidechain duck, reverb, delay), SP-1200 12-bit mode, an SVC-350 vocoder model, stem separation and WAV export.

## Put it online with GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo and upload these files to it (or push them).
2. In the repo, open Settings, then Pages. Under "Branch", pick `main` and `/ (root)`, then Save.
3. After a minute, open `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` in Chrome on your phone.
4. In Chrome's menu, tap "Add to Home screen".

## Using a USB-C interface
Plug it in, open the Audio tab and tap Enable input. When Chrome asks, allow the microphone. Pick the interface under Setup, then Device if it isn't the default.
